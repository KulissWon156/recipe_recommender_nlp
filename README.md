# NLP Based Recipe Recommendation System :yum: 

It is time to cook lunch and you open your refrigerator just to find that you have celery, broccoli, eggs, and oranges. What to cook out of it? I would say it takes me a few Google searches and reading a few blogs to find a recipe that involves these ingredients to cook.

I usually get frustrated by the last-minute hassle of finding out a relevant recipe to try. I believe the hostel dwellers, working and busy moms, and casual cooks need something quick and easy to cater to them with the most relevant recipe.

Motivated by this need, I decided to build a **recommender system to suggest recipes based on user input.**

**Recommender Systems** are employed everywhere in most of the apps that we use. It automatically suggests the relevant options, topics, music, food, and movies to help us make better choices. When it comes to implementing NLP in recommender, it utilizes the similarity of the content. In this project we are using NLP content-based filtering to suggest users with top recipes relevant to what data they enter - be it recipe name, or ingredient list.  

In our project we only have text data of recipes, we don't have metadata like cuisine type, difficulty level, cook-time, seasonal data, or user-generated content (e.g., comments, votes, and reviews).
